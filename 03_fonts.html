	<p align="justify">In fast growing modern world many types of vehicles are being innovated. 
But until now it is a major problem for the physically challenged peoples to move 
back the vehicles and to “U” turn the vehicles. Even to a small distance they 
cannot move the vehicles backside. So To eliminate this problem we invent the 
reverse gear mechanism in two wheeler. The challenged peoples can easily reverse 
the vehicles without getting down from the vehicle by easily operating hand lever. 
The project title is “REVERSE GEAR MECHANISM IN TWO WHEELER FOR 
PHYSICALLY CHALLENGED PEOPLE”. The main objective of our project is to 
facilitate ‘comfort ability and safety’ to the challenged peoples. This project 
requires the Engine, lever, reverse gear box, chain drive, sprocket and other 
necessary parts. When need to reverse the vehicles they can engage the hand lever 
for reverse gear, the vehicle moves backwards. This project will be more useful for 
the challenged peoples in the society</p></font>
